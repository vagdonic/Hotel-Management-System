### Introduction:
The Hotel Management System (HMS) is a resource planning for a hotel. It is an enterprise to help maintain and track the food orders of customers and take care of their orders if they make any amendments or cancel their order.

### Description:
It is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to manage the hotel. It helps the hotel manager to manage the orders in a proper way, using which he/she can keep the track of the orders pending and the orders to be placed in future and manage the orders which are cancelled as well. All the hotel login and register modules are in the system, using which the customers can register and log into the site.
These modules will also help the manager to keep track of a particular order of a particular customer.

### Pros:

- Low chances of errors.
- Better management and boost in business.

### Cons:
